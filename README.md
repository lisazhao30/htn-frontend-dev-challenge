## How to Set Up
1. Run "npm run start" in the backend and frontend folders

## Tech Stack
- React, JavaScript, TailwindCSS frontend. I specifically used DaisyUI's TailwindCSS framework as the prebuilt components were visually pleasing and has high user accessibility. 
- MongoDB, Express, Node.js for the backend. I chose to use a MERN stack as I am most familiar with it. As someone who has upcoming midterms, I decided it would be best to use technology that I am already familiar with in order to be efficient with time.
- Lastly, I used Axios to fetch the data from the HTN API
