# htn-frontend-dev-challenge
 
## How to Set Up
1. Run "npm run start" in the backend and frontend folders

## Tech Stack
- React, JavaScript, TailwindCSS frontend. I specifically used DaisyUI's TailwindCSS framework as the prebuilt components were visually pleasing and has high user accessibility. 
- MongoDB, Express, Node.js for the backend. I chose to use a MERN stack as I am most familiar with it. As someone who has upcoming midterms, I decided it would be best to use technology that I am already familiar with in order to be efficient with time.
- Lastly, I used Axios to fetch the data from the HTN API

## Areas of Development I Focused On
- Scalability: 
- Maintainability: 
- Readability: I commented relevant information concerning the various functions I had or any important components

## Development Thought Process


## Improvements
- Testing: to increase scalability and maintainability, it is very important to have tests (unit, integration, end to end) to ensure that if something in the code does break in the future then developers are notified before pushing to development. For my code, I would include integration tests for fetching the data, frontend unit tests (e.g., snapshot UI), and server-side unit tests for MongoDB. 
- User Accessible Design: to increase scalability for a larger audience, there are several improvements that could be done to make my website more accessible. For users with motor issues, I would implement keyboard functions to allow them to proceed to the next field in my login/register page. Not to mention, if I were to add new visual components then I would like to include visual components that can be understood cross-culturally.
